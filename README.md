# 💘 Flagrant
### Because love is temporary, but red flags are forever.
**Flagrant** is a tongue-in-cheek AI-powered dating assistant built for **Valentine’s Day**, when everyone is either:
- falling in love,
- overanalyzing a “good morning” text, or
- one DM away from emotional damage.
We help you do what your friends should be doing — judge your situationship objectively.

👉 **Live site**: https://flagrant.vercel.app


## 🌹 The Story
It’s Valentine’s Day.

You’ve matched.

You’ve flirted.

You’ve reread the same message 12 times.

Instead of spiraling alone, you open **Flagrant**.

Flagrant doesn’t ask “how does this make you feel?”

Flagrant asks **“is this person about to ruin your life?”**

## ✨ Features
### 💞 Compatibility Check
Upload your profile and your crush’s profile, and let the AI evaluate:
- Emotional compatibility
- Lifestyle alignment
- Chaos potential
- Overall “should I pursue this or run” score
- 
You’ll get:
- A compatibility percentage
- A breakdown of emotional + lifestyle fit
- A chaotic but honest verdict
- Lightly unhinged commentary (because therapy is expensive)

## 🚩 Red Flag Detector
Paste a conversation (yes, that one).

Flagrant will:
- Read between the lines
- Translate suspicious messages
- Identify manipulation, avoidance, and delusion
- Suggest your next move:
  + **Pivot** (change the dynamic)
  + **Slow down** (protect your peace)
  + **Eject** (block, heal, thrive)
  
Includes two modes:
- **Brutally Honest** – truth hurts
- **Delulu Mode** – truth but make it ✨copium✨


## Why This Exists
Online dating is:
- vague
- emotionally inefficient
- full of people who “don’t know what they want”

Flagrant exists to:
- reduce overthinking
- validate your gut feelings
- and gently (or aggressively) remind you that **you deserve better**
